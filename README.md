# Machine_Learning_Notes
This repo consists of jupyter notebooks and actual handwritten notes for machine learning and mathematics. I documented this repo for my personal reference, but why not share it with aspiring data scientists and engineers? :) Feel free to contribute if you're a pro! ;)

# Objective
* Facilitate the learning of core ML algorithms and its maths.
* Can be use as a reference to recall and implement ML elements. 
* Provide handwritten mathematics and algorithm notes to the students. (Especially for KU students!). 
* Can be used as a reference for semester projects. 

# Setup
**Run the script setup.py to install all ML related packages and download handwritten notes from my drive**
* (Making a VirtualEnv is recommended!)
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 setup.py
```
Check ./HandWrittenNotes after running the setup.py script.
