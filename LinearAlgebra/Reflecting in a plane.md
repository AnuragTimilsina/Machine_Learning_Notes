# Reflecting in a plane

## Aim

- Find coordinates of the reflection of a point in a fancy plane
- Transforming vector $\vec{r}$ to $\vec{r}\prime$ will involve a lot of trigonometry
- Simplify this process using inverse, transforms and orthogonal basis set vectors

## Steps

- Given $\vec{r}$, we can transform it to $\vec{r}\prime$ using the following
  - Multiply with $\boldsymbol{E^{-1}}$ to transform the vector in panda's basis to our orthonormal basis vector set
  - Perform the transformation $\boldsymbol{T_e}$ and transform the vector in our basis set
  - Convert the transformed vector back to panda's basis vector set by multiplying it with $\boldsymbol{E}$
  - Hence, the matrix will be

$$\boldsymbol{E}\boldsymbol{T_e}\boldsymbol{E^{-1}}$$

- Given vectors $v_1,v_2, v_3$, first construct the orthonormal basis vector set $\boldsymbol{E} = (e_1, e_2, e_3)$ using the Gram- Schmidtt process
- Once we have $\boldsymbol{E}$, we can compute the inverse of E. This will be simple in our case as for an orthonormal basis vector set, $\boldsymbol{E^{-1}} = \boldsymbol{E^T}$
- Once computed, we now have to generate our transformation matrix. If we are performing reflection, then the transformation matrix will generated by negating the last component of the vector(watch from 7:00 [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/lecture/oXE0Y/example-reflecting-in-a-plane)).
- Hence, $T_e = \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&-1\end{bmatrix}$
- We can then multiply the result from above with $\boldsymbol{E}$ to get back the vector in the panda basis set.
