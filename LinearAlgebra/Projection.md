# Projection

## Scalar projection
If we have two vectors `r` and `s`, we know using the cosine formula

$$r.s = |r||s|cos\theta$$

- $|s|cos\theta$ is the projection of s on r(see diagram in the lecture)
- $|s|cos\theta$ is called the projection OR the shadow of `s` onto `r`
- Multiplying $|s|cos\theta$, we get a scalar number. This is called _scalar projection_

## Vector projection

- Used to embed/represent information about `r` in the dot product. i.e encode something about the direction of `r` in the dot product
$$\text{vector projection} = r\text{ }\frac{r.s}{|r||r|}$$
$$\text{= } r \text{ }\frac{r.s}{r.r}$$
