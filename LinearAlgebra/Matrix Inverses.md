# Matrix Inverses

- We can use inveses to solve a system of equations

$$\boldsymbol{A}\text{ }r=s$$
$$=> r = \boldsymbol{A}^{-1}s$$

- Using Gaussian method of solve a system of equations, when the matrix is expresssed in traingle form, it is called `Echelon` form.
- To find inverse of a matrix, use the following

$$\boldsymbol{A}\text{ }B=\boldsymbol{I}$$
- Solve for B using A and I to get the inverse.
  - Write $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{I}$ together
  - Solve using Gaussian elimination
