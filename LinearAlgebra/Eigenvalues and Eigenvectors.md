# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- Eigen => Characteristic
- Eigenproblem => Characteristic problems of something. But what?
- When applying transformation to a vector, we can visualize it's changes
- However, this is difficult when applying the same transforms to all vectors in the space.
- Vectors which do not change/describe the amount by which a transformation has caused change in the system are called eigenvectors. The values(magnitude) of these changes in these vectors is valled *eigenvalue*
- Only vectors that lay on their original *SPAN* BEFORE AND AFTER THE TRANSFORMATION are called *eigenvectors*
