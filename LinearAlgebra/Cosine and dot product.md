# Cosine and dot product


If we have a triangle with sides a,b and c then

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 +2abcos(\theta)$$

- $\theta$ is the angle between sides `a` and `b`.

For vector notation,
$a = r$
$b = s$
$c = r - s$ (Refer diagram in the lecture)

Then,

$$|r-s|^2 = |r|^2 + |s|^2 + 2|r||s|cos\theta$$

Solving the left hand side and equating to the right hand side, we get

$$r.s = |r||s|cos\theta$$

- Hence, if two vectors are $90^{\degree}$ to each other, then their dot product will be ZERO(0)
